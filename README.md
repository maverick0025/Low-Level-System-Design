# Low-Level-System-Design

Most codes are from the book Head first design patterns
But I rewrote them for practice

## Iterator Pattern
- Started with merging two restaurants. This is where step1, step2 packages come in 
  - DinerMenu for lunch
  - PancakeHouseMenu for breakfast
- Next wanted to merge cafe restaurant also. 
- step3 package is transition makes required changes incode base to accomodate any new restaurant addition.
